I’m a DevSecOps engineer and cloud security practitioner who builds secure, automated infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and Kubernetes environments. Most of my work sits in-between cloud-native engineering and cybersecurity, where I focus on identity, hardened CI/CD pipelines, and GitOps-driven deployments. I work with Terraform, Helm, GitHub Actions, and containerized workloads to create systems that are consistent, scalable, and observable. Outside of cloud, I spend time in the ICS/OT world building hands-on PLC labs, analyzing Modbus/TCP traffic, and experimenting with OT. 

## What I Do

### DevSecOps / Cloud Engineering
I design and secure cloud-native infrastructure using Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, GitHub Actions, and AWS/Azure services. Most of my work centers on identity modernization, GitOps workflows, and hardening CI/CD pipelines.

### ICS/OT Cybersecurity
I build and test industrial control system environments using PLCs, Arduino Opta hardware, Modbus/TCP, and custom HMI tooling. My projects blend cloud-native monitoring with OT network defense, aiming to make industrial environments more transparent and testable.

### Software and Automation Projects
I am currently a student at CodeYou, learning C#. I'm developing several C# tools that support penetration testing workflows, reporting, and time management as part of my software engineering program.

### Homelab Work
My homelab includes a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster, Gitea, GitHub Actions runners, Portainer, and multiple ICS test rigs (my spouse doesn't love all these gadgets laying about). Many of the repositories here originate directly from these experiments.

## Technical Skills

**Cloud and Infrastructure**: AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Helm, Docker

**Automation and IaC**: Terraform, Ansible, GitOps, GitHub Actions

**Security and Networking**: Nmap, Wireshark, tcpdump, iptables, nftables, Nessus, Security Onion

**ICS/OT**:: Modbus/TCP, PLC programming (Arduino Opta, Click PLC), ICS network analysis

**Programming**: C#, Python, Bash, PowerShell, HCL, YAML, JSON

## Career Snapshot

### PenChecks Trust - DevSecOps Engineer  
Lead IAM Identity Center modernization, embed security tooling in CI/CD, harden GitOps workflows, and support AWS-native security guardrails while working directly with the CISO on incident response and security improvements.

### Defense Unicorns - DevSecOps Engineer  
Develop Helm charts, GitHub Actions pipelines, Kubernetes network policies, and observability tooling while supporting secure deployments across air‑gapped environments.

### Kentucky Army National Guard - Cyber Warrant Officer  
Conduct network defense, ICS/OT analysis, lab development, mentoring and supporting cyber operations for critical infrastructure scenarios.

### Coalfire Systems - Cloud Engineer  
Help organizations prepare for FedRAMP and cloud compliance through architecture design, documentation, scanning, and security engineering.

## Current Focus

- Scalable DevSecOps patterns for cloud-native systems
- Mentoring new professionals, refining my show-and-tell while simultaneously conquering my fear of public speaking
- Making better, more secure guardrails in CI
- Building C# tooling for penetration testing workflows and reporting  
- Discovering where I can contribute to open source software outside of my own GitHub
